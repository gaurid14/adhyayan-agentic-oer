# Adhyayan – Agentic Open Educational Resources Platform

## Project Overview
Adhyayan is an agent-driven Open Educational Resources (OER) platform. The objective of the project is to automate and streamline the complete lifecycle of educational content, starting from submission by contributors to evaluation, selection, and structured release for learners.

The system adopts an agentic architecture where multiple specialized agents collaborate to perform clearly defined tasks. This approach reduces manual intervention, improves transparency, and enables scalable content evaluation and management. The project is academic and research-oriented in nature and is not intended as a commercial product.

## Objectives
- Automate the submission, evaluation, and release of educational content  
- Implement a parameter-driven and transparent evaluation mechanism  
- Reduce administrative effort through intelligent agents  
- Design a modular and extensible system architecture  
- Gain hands-on experience with agent-based workflows and applied AI concepts

## System Architecture
The platform is built using a multi-agent architecture. Each agent is responsible for a specific stage in the content lifecycle.

### Submission Agent
- Accepts content submissions from contributors  
- Performs basic validation and structuring of submitted content  
- Stores content metadata for downstream processing  

### Evaluation Agent
- Evaluates submitted content using predefined academic and quality parameters  
- Applies scoring and filtering logic  
- Supports hybrid evaluation approaches combining rule-based logic and AI-assisted analysis  

### Admin and Decision Agent
- Acts as the final authority in the decision-making process  
- Reviews evaluation results  
- Approves, rejects, or requests revisions for submitted content  
- Controls readiness of content for release  

### Content Release Layer
- Publishes approved content for learners  
- Organizes content based on subject, syllabus, and difficulty level  
- Ensures controlled and structured access to resources
